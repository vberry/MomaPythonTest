We had (and still have) very few tuition hours to focus on the Unix system, which is however inescapable in Computer Science. Yet, this is a topic with which students are not familiar when reaching college and university. Moreover, our students\\n', 'have highly heterogeneous previous knowledge in IT and CS, coming from various backgrounds and education systems.

It does not provide Unix lessons nor course notes on that topic: we trust you on that. The tool is meant as a companion for a Unix course. Of particular importance is the fact that you introduce your students with archives (`.tar.gz` files), as knowledge on this point is a prerequisite for students to use the tool. In the near future we will provide on this site a small introductory video on that topic as an additional assistance for students.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '## Your turn now\\n', '\\n', 'Now the tool is yours to try, to use and to grow! \\n', \"A warning though: _this_ instance of _ShellOnYou_ was tested for several dozen students using it at various moments during days (and nights, they're crazy! :-). So be careful in trying it with several hundreds or thousands, it might no stand it.
